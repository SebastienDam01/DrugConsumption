# DrugConsumption

This project is part of the course **"Data analysis and data mining"**, to be done in a group of 3 students. 
It consisted of analysing a dataset by applying supervised and/or unsupervised methods in most cases, via Python. 

To this extent, we chose a dataset named **"Drug Consumption"**. 
The goal was to study people's personalities in order to predict some features that may indicate a higher rate of consumption. 

The project was done via **Google Collab**. The following files were created : 
- *DrugConsumption.py* establishes the analysis of the dataset and contains ML methods. 
- *Pleiades.py* is a sub file of this project and aims to group some drugs together depending on people's habits of consuming them. 
- *Report.pdf* is a report of this project and had to be written with maximum 12 pages. 

Only the report was asked to be given to the teacher. That's why the coding style appears to be quite light and the commentaries were written in french. Nevertheless, these files allows one to see what kind of methods we decided to use and the way we approached this project and dataset.
